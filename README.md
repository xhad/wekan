Upcoming Wekan App Development Platform will make possible
many use cases. If you don't find your feature or integration in
GitHub issues and [Features][features] or [Integrations][integrations]
page at wiki, please add them.

We are very welcoming to new developers and teams to submit new pull
requests to devel branch to make this Wekan App Development Platform possible
faster. Please see [Developer Documentation][dev_docs] to get started.
We also welcome sponsors for features, although we don't have any yet.

and new features added by growing Wekan developer community.

Actual work happens at [Wekan GitHub issues][wekan_issues].
